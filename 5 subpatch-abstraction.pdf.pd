#X text 8 27 Subpatches are self contained parts of your patch that
\; have their own canvas and use inlets and outlets to \; receive or
send data to its parent patch. \; Subpatches also can contain subpatches!

you change one subpatch all other subpatches \; in you patch wont change.

#X text 557 23 To create reusable components you can use an abstraction.
\; Abstraction work like subpatches but they are saved to \; their
own file;
#X text 558 92 To create an asbtraction you have to save its file to
the \; same directory as the patch that wants to use it.;

abstraction;
